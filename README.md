# Backend overview
This project serves as the backend for the hotbutterfly project of ranking butterfly beauty in pairwise contests. The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/jzengg/hotbutterfly-ui). This is a simple flask app that exposes endpoints to manage matches (a pairwise contest between two butterflies), butterfly rankings, and session tracking (to manage fraud). We use alembic to manage our database migrations and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.
